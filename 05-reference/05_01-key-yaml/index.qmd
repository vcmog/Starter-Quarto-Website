### Authoring - Markdown basics

``` ::: content ::: ``` -> ``` <div> <p> content </p> <div> ``` 

<details><summary>Asking CHATGPT about this notation...</summary><br>

<ul>
ME: do you know what ::: is? Maybe related to markdown.

CHATGPT: The ":::" is often used in markdown as a way to create a horizontal rule, which is a line that separates content on a webpage or document. It is used to visually break up sections of content and make them easier to read. It is supported by many markdown parsers and can be used in many different platforms like Github, Jupyter notebook, etc.

ME: is it related to breaks between cells in notebooks?

CHATGPT: No, the ":::" is not typically used to indicate breaks between cells in notebooks. Notebooks, such as Jupyter, use specific syntax to separate code cells, such as using "---" or "***" in markdown cells or using "#%%" in code cells.

It's not a standard syntax, but some people use it as a way to separate cells in jupyter notebook but it is not officially supported and different from the standard way which is using the command "---" or "***" in markdown cell or using "#%%" in code cells.
